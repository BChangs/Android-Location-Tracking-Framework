# Android Location Tracking Framework
Framework for an Android activity that can retrieve GPS coordinates of users every x seconds and store it on a Firebase database under a seperate section for each user. This code was made for the Android application "Map the Masses" to track pedestrian movement and visualize crowded areas around your location.

To use this code, simply create a new activity/layout for your application. Make sure it is listed in your manifest file. Then insert this code into the java activity file. Substitute in the name of your project/layout/values as needed.
