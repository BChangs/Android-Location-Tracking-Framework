# Android Location Tracking Framework
Framework for an Android activity that can retrieve GPS coordinates of users every x seconds and store it on a Firebase database under a seperate section for each user. This code was made for the Android application "Map the Masses" to track pedestrian movement and visualize crowded areas around your location.
